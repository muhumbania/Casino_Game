# Casino_Game

This is a casino mini project that I will be doing in Js and jQuery and a add a user interface using HTML and CSS.
When the game starts, the user will be given some money to start with, the computer will ask the user to enter un number between a certain range and enter the bet amount, if the User guesses the right number, he gains 100% of his bet, if he guesses if the number was odd or even, he gains 50% of his bet. If he doesn't get even the number or the color neither, he loses his bet.
